    <p style="text-align: center">
      Robots of all forms are useful for many activities.
      This is particularly apparent when robot tasks are narrowly defined, such as in manufacturing pick-and-place, package handling, or industrial welding.
      There are, however, many robotic applications in which the required tasks cannot exclusively be known a priori.
      These can range from disaster response, unmanned platform maintenance, and nuclear clean-up to everyday household activities or robots in the retail setting.
      Humanoid robots present a unique means for interacting with such unstructured environments designed for humans, and they have characteristics well-suited for dynamic interactions and the performance of varying, often unforeseen, tasks in a human-centered world.
      They are not without downsides, however, including significant electromechanical complexity and the need for high power and complex control schemes.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center">
      This workshop seeks to gain insight on why and how humanoid robots provide an advantage over other robotic archetypes in dynamic environments, while also pursuing an answer to the question of when, and in what applications, is a humanoid the right solution.
      Experts in the field, both researchers and end-users, will provide keynote presentations addressing their rationale for pursuing humanoid robots; brief presentations of peer-reviewed submissions will be solicited that examine the advantages and disadvantages of the humanoid form; and a facilitated audience-wide discussion will draw out thoughts from the community about pros, cons, and an effective means for building the case for, or against, humanoid-related work.
      Ultimately, the objective of this workshop is to foment publishable material presenting quantifiable rationale for using humanoid robots across a variety of applications.
